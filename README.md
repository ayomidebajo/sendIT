# sendIT
Send files to anyone using https

This project is built with Rust

Special thanks to @vishaltelangre for his project on searching files! I implemented his logic and remixed it for this project.

Videos on how to use this project coming soon!

## How to run this project

Download Ngrok into your machine

To receive open your terminal and run `cargo run` and then open another terminal from the root of your computer and run `ngrok http 8080` this will expose your receiever's port for two hours. The reciever's port is 8080

Next type `ifconfig` this command helps to tell you your machine's ip addr. Just look out for the Key `CSUM>` you'll see it beside "inet" (i.e "inet 198:991:900:00). Copy this or keep it somewhere. Then add the port number to it (i.e 198:991:900:00:8080). This is what the sender will use in the argument for the port address when sending.

To send, go back to the project directory, in another laptop to test out this functionality of sending to a different computer (you also open another terminal instead). To run the sender's functionality type `cargo run FILENAME PORT_ADDRESS` 

The receiver should receive the fileâœ¨

Note the file search is only within your project directory!

This projects works well for Mac and Linux users, not so sure about windows PCs.
